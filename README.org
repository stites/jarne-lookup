#+title: jarne-lookup

A quick little binary to get lookup into rofi. You can build the project with
nix (~nix build~) or cabal (~cabal build jarne-lookup~). If you use nix, you
will probably want to use [[https://app.cachix.org/cache/stites][my cache]].

A quick demo [[./static/demo.mp4][can be found here]].
